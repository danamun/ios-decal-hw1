//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

    var wordA : String!

        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q1 HERE]
    //You don't have to unwrap because words can hold nil values.

    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}

            }

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q2 HERE]
    
    // Varible i should have been "var" because it is being mutated in the for loop. "let" means you can't change the value of the variable.
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
// I changed initializing the dictionary to [Characters : Int]()
// And then at the end you had to return true.
//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
